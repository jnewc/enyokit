# enyokit #

enyokit is a powerful extension library for EnyoJS. It provides a new set of controls and components that harness the power of webkit and it's many optimizations to provide a development experience that is perfect for targeting mobile web applications on a number of platforms.

## Notes ##

At this early stage, the library is very much an amalgamation of kinds that have been imported from other projects I've worked on, and some PHP bindings to bypass the cross-domain barrier so you can test in Chrome/Safari/whatever.

More details as soon as there are any. Bug reports appreciated, but keep feature requests on standby for now.

Wiki should be available soon at http://enyokit.com/wiki
